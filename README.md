# Octodex

Recreate the github octodex page as closely as possible. Use the same sizes and colors. Download some of your favorites
Use some Octocat images to use in your page (5 or so). Layout should be flexible but doesn't need to beerfectly responsive.
Use CSS media queries to resize the Octocat containers to look great as the screen changes size. Even though the site has desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile display, for explorer mode only worry about desktop and mobile.
Deploy your site.
